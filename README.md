# ztd

ztd stands for zero todo. It's a small script that will create a zero byte file and name it with the task you want todo. The file is save on your desktop in a folder called todo. The script was tested on a Mac, but it should be easy for you to customize it to your system and setup. ztd will create the folder called todo if it doesn't exist yet. 

1. Add ztd.sh to your path
2. From a terminal type ztd.sh "Something you want todo"
3. Check the todo folder for tasks
4. Delete the task file once you completed it
